prompt engineering:
 Zero-shot,
 Few-shot,
 Chain-of-thought


Best Prompt Techniques:
 1) Start simple and itrative => improve prompt step by step,
 2) Clear instruction => instruction, input, ask for output
 3) Be spacific and detailed => To the point instruction,
 4) Give required output formate example for better results
 5) Don't give negative info => Tell what to do instead not do this/that
 6) Move from Easy to complex => simple short to few short
 7) Reduce unecessary info => tell quantity of text for results in 2/3 lines
 8) Give leading points or starting points => import, SELECT in sql


Structured Output:
 1) Give example in prompt to get structure output like json data etc,
 2) Example in pormpt & add property "response_format: {type: 'json_object'}"
 3) use instructor library it will validate and retries for required output
 4) provide proper json schema for required output(not properly supported)
